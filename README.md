# StaVerGt

Anveshak is used to generate groundtruth for the StaVer dataset. The images in the dataset consist of 
various regions like logo, headers, text, signature, headline, bold text, etc. 
However, annotation of stamp regions is only available with the original dataset. 
The dataset consists of 425 scanned images in $600$, $300$, and $200$ $dpi$ resolutions. 
Out of these 425 images, 344 images contain non overlapping regions. 
Anveshak is used to annotate these 344 images of 300 dpi resolution.
